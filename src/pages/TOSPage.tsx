        This is a personal hobby project called Personal Drive. By using it, you
        acknowledge and agree to the following:
        <ul>
          <li>
            1. What We Collect If you create an account or upload files, we
            store basic information (email, files, etc.) temporarily on our
            servers. Your files may be processed to enable search or
            question-answering features.
          </li>
          <li>
            2. No Guarantees on Security I do not guarantee the security of your
            data. While I try to keep things safe, this is not a
            production-grade or professionally audited system. Use it at your
            own risk. I am not responsible for any data leaks, unauthorized
            access, or loss of information.
          </li>
          <li>
            3. Data Usage Files are not shared or sold. Files may be processed
            by AI models to provide functionality.
          </li>
          <li>
            4. Deletion You can delete your files or account at any time, but
            deletion is not guaranteed to be permanent immediately.
          </li>
          <li>
            5. Updates This Privacy Policy may change anytime. Check back
            occasionally.

        Welcome to Personal Drive, a personal experiment for learning and
        testing. By using this service, you agree to these terms:
        <ul>
          <li>
            1. No Liability This app is provided as-is, with no warranties of
            any kind. I’m a student/hobbyist—if the site goes down, loses your
            data, or exposes it unintentionally, I’m not liable. You’re fully
            responsible for anything you upload or store here.
          </li>
          <li>
            2. Acceptable Use Don’t upload illegal, abusive, or copyrighted
            content. Don’t try to hack, reverse-engineer, or abuse the service.
          </li>
          <li>
            3. Your Content You own your uploaded files. I won’t use them beyond
            providing you features (like search or Q&A). I do not sell or share
            your content.
          </li>
          <li>
            4. Service May Break or End This is an experimental app. I may shut
            it down, lose data, or change features without warning.
          </li>
          <li>
            5. Changes I might update these terms anytime. Continued use means
            you agree to the latest version.
